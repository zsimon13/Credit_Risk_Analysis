# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
Good credit and loans vastly outnumber risky credit and loans. This analysis takes this unbalance into consideration and tests different algorithims to see which method provides an optimal result for determining whether or not a customer should be approved for a loan.

## Results
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.


## Summary
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
